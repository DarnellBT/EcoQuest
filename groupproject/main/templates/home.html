                <h2>What is <span class="highlight">Sustainability</span>?</h2>
                <p>To begin, let's talk about what sustainability actually is. Sustainability is a social goal for us to co-exist with our planet for as long as possible. In other words, the aim is to be able to do the things we do daily, whilst minimizing the negative impact on the Earth. This could be done in many different ways, which we will go through to try and help you understand further.</p>
                <p>One main practice for improving sustainability is recycling. Recycling is the process of converting waste into reusable material. A big example of this is reusing plastic bottles and making it useful again. There are large repercussions for a lack of plastic recycling, such as climate change and plastic pollution, leading to death of Sealife. Currently, at least 1,000 turtles die each year due to plastic (thatâ€™s one turtle every 9 hours!). The benefits of recycling are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce depletion of natural resources, and decrease the release of toxic substances into the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>By embracing sustainability, we can work towards a future where economic growth, environmental health, and human well-being coexist harmoniously. Every action, no matter how small, contributes to a more sustainable world.</p>
